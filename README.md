# MyMenu

## Overview

This is the backend application for the meal and shopping list management system. It provides APIs to manage meals and shopping lists, including CRUD operations for meals, plates, and products. The backend is built using Spring Boot with REST APIs to interact with the frontend.

## Features üìã

- Meal Management: Create, retrieve, update, and delete meals for specific days and meal types (breakfast, lunch, dinner).

- Plate Assignment: Assign plates to meals for specific days.

- Product Management: Create, retrieve, update, and delete products in a shopping list.

- Meal Querying: Retrieve meals for a specified date range or specific meal type.

- Product Shopping List: Manage a list of products (add, edit, delete, delete all).

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è

- Spring Boot: For building the backend APIs.

- JPA (Java Persistence API): For interacting with the database.

- PostgreSQL: Database for storing meals, plates, and products.

- Maven: For dependency management and building the project.
